List of tasks to do to learn a 
new programming language 
but only spending 10 minutes a day

Todos:
1. capitalize and lowercase strings
2. print out the current date/time
3. print out date/time on a different format
4. print out a date/time on a specific timezone
5. for loop: list of time on different timezones (associative array or standard object)
6. complete 24 timezones list (numeric array of objects/assoc array)
7. add 1 hour interval to current time and output (date/time manipulation [oop??])
8. get date yesterday (date/time manipulation [substraction and rounding off])
9. get remaining seconds on the day
10. get remaining milliseconds of the day
11. get remaining microseconds on the day
12. ask for input and convert to unix timestamp
13. ask for input and tell how old it is in days (rounded off) [substraction, division]
14. ask for date input and tell how many days remaining until said date, but throw an error if it's a not future date (substraction, division)
15. output fibonacci sequence (base 1) on each keypress
16. concatenate integer, float, boolean and string
17. convert array to a comma separated string
18. reverse string using built in function(s) 
19. reverse string using loop by character iteration
20. reverse string using function recursion
21. split string using a delimiter
22. get the domain of an email address
23. ask for input but only accept numbers
24. ask for input but only accept whole numbers
25. ask for input and tell if it's even or odd number
26. ask for input but only accept even numbers
27. ask for input but only accept odd numbers
28. ask for number input as a radian angle, convert to degree angle
29. ask for number input as a degree angle, convert to radian angle
30. email validation through regex (hardcoded, no input)
31. ask for input and validate as email
32. ask for 2 inputs and then output them 5 seconds later
33. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate triangle area
34. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate the circumference of the rectangle
35. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate rectangle area
36. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the hypotenuse
37. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the circumference
38.  ask for 3 number inputs as triangle legs, and determine the type of the triangle (right, iso, scalene)
39.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and adjacent leg of a right triangle, to get length of the opposite leg
40.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg of a right triangle respectively, to get length of the adjacent leg
41. TOA: ask for 2 number inputs as the length opposite and adjacent legs relative to one of the corners of a right triangle, to get the angle of that corner.
42. SOH: ask for 2 number inputs as the length of opposite(relative to corner x) and the length of hypotenuse of a right triangle to calculate the angle of corner x(theta)
43. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg(relative to theta), to calculate the length hypotenuse of a right angle
44. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and length of hypotenuse, to calculate the length of the opposite leg(relative to theta)
45. CAH: Ask for 2 number inputs: the length of the adjacent side (relative to corner x) and the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Calculate the angle of corner x (theta).
46. CAH: Ask for a degree angle input (theta) and one number input as the adjacent leg (relative to theta). Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
47. CAH: Ask for a degree angle input (theta) and one number input as the hypotenuse. Use these to calculate the length of the adjacent leg (relative to theta).
