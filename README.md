List of tasks to do to learn a 
new programming language 
but only spending 10 minutes a day

Todos:
1. print out the current date/time
2. print out date/time on a different format
3. print out a date/time on a specific timezone
4. for loop: list of time on different timezones
5. complete 24 timezones list
6. add interval to current time
7. get date yesterday
8. get remaining seconds on the day
9. get remaining milliseconds of the day
10. get remaining microseconds on the day
11. ask for input and convert to unix timestamp
12. ask for input and tell how old it is in days (rounded off) [substraction, division]
13. ask for date input and tell how many days remaining until said date, but throw an error if it's a not future date (substraction, division)
14. output fibonacci sequence (base 1) on each keypress
15. concatenate integer, float, boolean and string
16. convert array to a comma separated string
17. capitalize and lowercase strings
18. reverse string using built in function(s)
19. reverse string using loop by character iteration111111
20. reverse string using function recursion
21. split string using a delimiter
22. get the domain of an email address
23. ask for input but only accept numbers
24. ask for number input as a radian angle, convert to degree angle
25. ask for number input as a degree angle, convert to radian angle
26. email validation through regex
27. ask for input and validate as email
28. ask for 2 inputs and then output them 5 seconds later
29. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate triangle area
30. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate the circumference of the rectangle
31. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate rectangle area
32. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the hypotenuse
33. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the circumference
34.  ask for 3 number inputs as triangle legs, and determine the type of the triangle (right, iso, scalene)
35.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and adjacent leg of a right triangle, to get length of the opposite leg
36.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg of a right triangle respectively, to get length of the adjacent leg
37. TOA: ask for 2 number inputs as the length opposite and adjacent legs relative to one of the corners of a right triangle, to get the angle of that corner.
38. SOH: ask for 2 number inputs as the length of opposite(relative to corner x) and the length of hypotenuse of a right triangle to calculate the angle of corner x(theta)
39. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg(relative to theta), to calculate the length hypotenuse of a right angle
40. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and length of hypotenuse, to calculate the length of the opposite leg(relative to theta)
41. CAH: Ask for 2 number inputs: the length of the adjacent side (relative to corner x) and the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Calculate the angle of corner x (theta).
42. CAH: Ask for a degree angle input (theta) and one number input as the adjacent leg (relative to theta). Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
43. CAH: Ask for a degree angle input (theta) and one number input as the hypotenuse. Use these to calculate the length of the adjacent leg (relative to theta).
