new programming language 
but only spending 10 minutes a day

Todos:
1. print out the current date/time
2. print out date/time on a different format
3. print out a date/time on a specific timezone
4. for loop: list of time on different timezones
5. complete 24 timezones list
6. add interval to current time
7. get date yesterday
8. get remaining seconds on the day
9. get remaining milliseconds of the day
10. get remaining microseconds on the day
11. ask for input and convert to unix timestamp
12. ask for input and tell how old it is in days (rounded off)
13. concatenate integer, float, boolean and string
14. convert array to a comma separated string
15. capitalize and lowercase strings
16. reverse string using built in function(s)
17. reverse string using loop by character iteration
18. reverse string using function recursion
19. split string using a delimiter
20. get the domain of an email address
21. ask for input but only accept numbers
22. email validation through regex
23. ask for input and validate as email
24. ask for 2 inputs and then output them 5 seconds later
25. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate triangle area
26. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate the circumference of the rectangle
27. ask for 2 number inputs as adjacent rectangle legs and calculate rectangle area
28. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the hypotenuse
29. ask for 2 number inputs as right triangle legs and calculate the circumference
30.  ask for 3 number inputs as triangle legs, and determine the type of the triangle (right, iso, scalene)
31.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and adjacent leg of a right triangle, to get length of the opposite leg
32.  TOA: ask for 1 degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg of a right triangle respectively, to get length of the adjacent leg
33. TOA: ask for 2 number inputs as the length opposite and adjacent legs relative to one of the corners of a right triangle, to get the angle of that corner.
34. SOH: ask for 2 number inputs as the length of opposite(relative to corner x) and the length of hypotenuse of a right triangle to calculate the angle of corner x(theta)
35. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and opposite leg(relative to theta), to calculate the length hypotenuse of a right angle
36. SOH: ask for a degree angle input and 1 number input as theta and length of hypotenuse, to calculate the length of the opposite leg(relative to theta)
